This project documents my experience in the UMich MADS Program. It will contain some of my homework and my impressions on each class as I take them. 
As a frame of reference, I aim for a B+ in all my classes because I have so many other competing priorities between work and my personnal life. I started
out taking two classes a month, but dropped down to one because the time commitment became unpredictable/unmanagable.

### SIADS 501: Being a Data Scientist

I found this class to be frustrating. The material was very straightforward, but the grading was highly subjective and did not appear to be linked to a 
rubric, despite one being provided. This frustration with grading was experienced by nearly all of my peers. Grading of assignments was not timely, but 
they expected you to work in the feedback into your submission the next week, even if it came out hours before the next submission date. The time 
commitment in this class was evenly distributed, and took me about 15 hours a week between all the writing, lectures, and meeting with my peers. 

The entire gist of the class was to discuss the stages of a data science project. They consider this framework in four stages: Problem Formulation, Data 
Collection and Cleaning, Data Analysis and Modeling, and Presentation. If you are familiar with Agile, Lean, or Six Sigma, this material is near 
identical but with different names. The work in this class was focused on writing a "manifesto" on two projects of your choice. Me and most of my 
peers ended up writing a document approximately 35 pages in length. As you wrote, you were required to review and provide feedback to your peers. 

### SIADS 502: Math Methods for Data Science

Before I tell you about this class, realize I have a prior Masters Degree in Mathematics. So I may not be the best person to discuss the difficulty of
this class. 

I found this class to be really simple, but the learning materials need serious revision. When I took this, there were two lecturers, one male and 
one female. They both had a solid grasp on the mathematics, but the handwriting was hard to read at times, and both of them used notation practices 
that were spotty. They would randomly switch trains of thought and insert notation in previous lines. I followed it okay, but if I were to print final
versions of each slide for notes, I would not be able to figure out what they did, which is a problem. The only other comment I have on the mathematics 
is that the TAs repeatedly told students that practically zero (e.g., something like 0.0000000001) and zero are the same thing. From a theoretical 
perspective, this is not accurate, and if you were trying to build robust functions, there are significant implications to that guidance I think 
they didn't fully consider or understand. My time commitment for this class was minimal every week, hovering right around 2.5 hours. I spent more 
time doing the lectures than doing the homework. Grading expectations were clear. Grading was done promptly.

Material covered in the class included the basics of matrices, basic probability, and gradient decent/ascent. The homework was centered on doing 30 or so
problems per week. Most were done with a few lines of code, but there were random problems that needed to be done by hand. I could see knowing when to 
do things by hand would have been hard for people learning the material for the first time.

### SIADS 503: Data Science Ethics

This class was super interesting. The presentation of the material was really well done, and the mix of required and recommended reading was very engaging. It was a little odd to have a virtual visit from a dog every week, but it added flavor to the class. The instructional team provided good feedback on the assignments, and the writing prompts for each memo were clear. The projected time committments for each assignment was about a half hour to high in each case, but it was very close in the scheme of things. Each week had a quiz you could attempt one time. You really need to do the reading and watch the lectures closely. There is a lot of application in the quizzes. 

The reading and video lectures took me 6 - 8 hours a week, the quiz was another 20 minutes, and the writing assignment was another 4 hours or so. Considering all of the writing that occurred in this class, the instructional team was exceptional at getting the assignments back to us in a timely manner.

### SIADS 505: Data Manipulation

I found this class to be interesting. The material was fluxuated in depth, and you could have multiple points in the same lecture where it would go from 
simple to complicated to simple to complicated to ... I spent about 10 hours a week between the lectures and homework. Grading expectations were always
very clear. Grading was done promptly.

### SIADS 511: SQL & Databases

This class was super easy, and took less than 2 hours a week with the lectures and homework. I was pretty angry with myself for not pairing this class with another. If you sat down and focused, you could do this entire class in less than one full calendar day including meals and movie. If you have any familiarity with SQL, just knock this out and move on to another class.

### SIADS 515: Efficient Data Processing

This class was worth taking, and surprising well timed with my professional life. It covered the basics of the linux command line and processing data with it, generators, caching, decorators, and code profiling in Jupyter. This class was about 5 hours a week of lecture, homework, and playing around with material. I will definitely be going back to this material and practicing with the code profiling, caching, and linux command line to process data.

### SIADS 521: Visual Exploration of Data

I found this class to be interesting. The material was pretty straightforward and most of the grading expectations were solid enough. The time commitment
was very predictable until the last week. I spent maybe 8 hours a week on lectures and homework for the first three weeks, and spent 16+ hours in the 
last week. Grading was SSSSSLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW and resulting feedback was not terribly helpful.

The core of this class was built around how matplotlib works, how all of its' pieces come together, and exploring a few other visualization libraries of
your choice. I only had one complaint, and I think it was rooted in perspective I brought to the class. I had used matplotlib on and off for a few 
years prior to this course, so I had a reasonable familiarity with how it worked. The instructors started teaching the class as if we all had zero
exposure, which was fine, but they didn't discuss a general strategy for approaching/evaluating a big and complicated library like matplotlib. Their 
basic advice was to Google things, which is fine, but it would have been nice to really discuss how we navigate the documentation quickly to identify 
special cases and special features. 

### SIADS 522: Information Visualization I

I found this class to be really interesting. The material was very straightforward and grading expectations were clear. The time commitment in this 
class was progressive as the weeks went on. I started at 4 hours per week, and ended at 13 hours per week.  

It covered the basics of visualization theory using a visualization library I had no experience with: altair. My overall experience in this class was 
very positive, but the homework and amount of lecture time did get progressively more time intensive. The homework had us mimic graphics from 538 
exactly, so the majority of the time in homework was spent trying to find the correct options to mimic the graphics. This was a double edged sword in 
terms of grading because it was always extremely clear what we were aiming for, so minor deviances would be judged harshly.
